### Blog done using the Meteor framework

This blog is done up with the design inspiration of Obtvse, which is then inspired by Svbtle.

It is a multi-page app with backbone routing on the Meteor framework. This might defeat the purpose of using MeteorJS, but the framework itself provides an amateur programmer (aka me) an easy way to learn and create something useful for my own. 

The modules provided are awesome as well (though I do agree if they could simply just use more, it would be better). Particularly, adding backbone, jQuery, stylus and showdown (markdown HTML preprocessor) are a snap and that makes this framework so awesome.

And a very sweet bonus: deploying is easily taken care of with MeteorJS's servers.
