This blog is done up with the design inspiration of Obtvse, which is then inspired by Svbtle.

It is a multi-page app with backbone routing on the Meteor framework. This might defeat the purpose of using MeteorJS, but the framework itself provides an amateur programmer (aka me) an easy way to learn and create something useful for my own. 

Plus, deploying is easily taken care of with MeteorJS's servers.
