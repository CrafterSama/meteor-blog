### Blog done using the Meteor framework

##Work in progress - TODO:
- Markdown Preview 
- UI for internal interface/admin (+half done, no responsive yet)
- Header for blog.html (+done, fonts can't be placed in template)
- Upon server startup, create the admin account automatically
- Remove insecure package?
- Potentially add keyboard navigation
- Markdown has issues with quotes
- Live preview functionality
- Posts that are not published should not be accessible/viewed via URLs
- Create admin account on server run (since I can't create account by client after)

###DONE
- Account/login for blog owner (+done with accounts-password package and auth logic)
- Markdown Blog Input (+done with showdown package)

This blog is done up with the design inspiration of Obtvse, which is then inspired by Svbtle.

It is a multi-page app with backbone routing on the Meteor framework. This might defeat the purpose of using MeteorJS, but the framework itself provides an amateur programmer (aka me) an easy way to learn and create something useful for my own. 

The modules provided are awesome as well (though I do agree if they could simply just use more, it would be better). Particularly, adding backbone, jQuery, stylus and showdown (markdown HTML preprocessor) are a snap and that makes this framework so awesome.

And a very sweet bonus: deploying is easily taken care of with MeteorJS's servers.
